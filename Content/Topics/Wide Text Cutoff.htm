        <h1>ExtraWide Text Cutoff</h1>
        <p class="ExtraWide">This line of text is supposed to be very wide, especially on extra wide screens. The &lt;div&gt; containing this text should be dynamically shortened to prevent the text box from getting to be too unsightly. This way, it looks nice on wide screens without making the user read an extra long line that is only one or maybe even two lines long, which would be pretty ugly.</p>

        <h1>Sticky Footers</h1>
        <p>A "Sticky" Footer is a Footer element that is stuck to the bottom of the contents with various behavioral options, depending on the desired effect.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/" title="CSS-Tricks.com - Sticky Footers" alt="CSS-Tricks.com - Sticky Footers">This website</a> goes into more complete depth about the various options for Sticky Footers and covers general cases for how to implement them, which can be adapted to the &lt;div&gt; structure used by Flare when Building HTML5 output.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>One of the most common cases is to create a Footer that will always be at the bottom of the content in the Topic, but will "magnetize" to the lower extremity of the body-container &lt;div&gt; even when a short Topic's contents will not reach that low to "push" it down there.</p>

            <li>Footer will not be shown until scrolled to for longer contents</li>
        </ul>
